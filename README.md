# BlackJack
Simple BlackJack game made in Java
This was my first individual project made in Java.
I took a data structures class at Duke, but decided that 
I wanted to break more into the individual projects scene.
The project involves two classes: Card.java and BlackJackMain.java.
The Card class allows players to access their hands and totals,
as well as the dealer's hands and totals.
The BlackJackMain class runs the program and configures the winner.
